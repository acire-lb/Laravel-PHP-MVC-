MVC Pattern Laravel


# About:
This is a small Web App project based on a Work Placement project. This was implemented for learning purposes of the Laravel PHP MVC Framework. The app creates a place where users can login and add forms for asset ratings.

The placement project required an application that would allow admin users to enter in asset ratings for the conditions of building sites. Each form that this user needed to complete required different form layouts. WordPress was chosen for this application at it allowed the gravity forms plugin to add more control and was adaptble to meet future requirements. 
With this project I thought i would have a go at starting to create a project using Laravel to see if i can make a more customized application.
